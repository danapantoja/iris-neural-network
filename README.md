# iris-neural-network
This is a feedforward neural network implemented from scratch in Python using only NumPy. The network is trained on the classic Iris dataset (two classes: Setosa and Versicolor) to perform binary classification.

## Features

- Multiple layers with customizable sizes
- Sigmoid activation function
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Gradient descent backpropagation training
- Standardization of input features
- Train/test split evaluation
- Simple accuracy metric for performance

## Results

After training for 10,000 epochs, the neural network achieves approximately **97% accuracy** on the test set (binary classification of Setosa vs. Versicolor).
